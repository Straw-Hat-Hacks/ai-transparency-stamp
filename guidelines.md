## 💡 Why This Matters

Transparent attribution builds trust, encourages ethical AI use, and helps signal the value of human creativity in a world of automation.

If you're unsure which label to use, lean toward disclosure.  
The goal is not perfection, it's honesty.

## ✍️ Text Value Definitions

| Label | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `Human-written` | The text was entirely written by a human without any AI assistance. |
| `Human-edited AI draft` | The initial draft or outline was generated by AI, but it was significantly edited or rewritten by a human before publishing. |
| `AI-generated` | The text was produced by AI with little or no human revision. |

---

## 🎨 Image Value Definitions

| Label | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `Human-made` | The visual was created entirely by a human or non-AI generated (e.g., photography, illustration, design, screenshot). |
| `AI-generated` | The image was fully generated using AI tools (e.g., DALL·E, Midjourney, Firefly). |
| `Hybrid` | A human created or captured the base image, but it was modified, stylized, or enhanced using AI tools. |
