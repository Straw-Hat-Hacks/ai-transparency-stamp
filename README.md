# AI Transparency Stamp (AITS)

A minimal, open-labeling system to disclose the presence of AI-generated or AI-assisted content in social media posts, articles, and creative works.

## 🧠 Why This Project Exists

With AI-generated content rapidly filling our feeds, it’s becoming harder to tell what’s been written or created by a human versus an AI model. The **AI Transparency Stamp** is a simple, flexible framework that helps creators **disclose the role of AI** in their content — clearly, honestly, and consistently.

> This project encourages thoughtful, ethical use of AI tools, while promoting human creativity and trust.
